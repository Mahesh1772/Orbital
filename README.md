## Software Engineering Principles

### Modularity

- **User Interface Widgets:** Dividing UI elements into reusable modules for better code readability and flexibility.
- **Attendance and Statuses Tracking:** Separate document subcollections for efficient data organization and access.
- **Conducts and Duties Management:** Structured collection with specific fields for conduct and guard duty information.

### DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) Principle

- **Add and Edit Screens:** Reusing the same UI components with parameterization for efficient functionality.
- **Version Control with Git and GitHub:** Implementing branching and pull requests for effective collaboration without code duplication.

### Version Control

- **Branching:** Creating separate branches for distinct features and ensuring smooth integration with the main branch.
- **Pull Requests:** Facilitating a formal review process before merging changes, ensuring accountability and minimizing conflicts.

### Project Management

- **Sprint Cycles and Timeline:** Organizing work into weekly sprints with specific goals and deliverables.
- **Kanban Board:** Tracking feature implementation status and progress in a clear and organized manner.
- **Regular Communication:** Employing both live and asynchronous communication for effective collaboration and problem-solving.

### Use of Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern:** Enabling real-time data updates and seamless communication between UI elements.
- **State Management:** Implementing centralized data management and application state handling for enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Dashboard:** Overview of key metrics and real-time information for efficient decision-making.
- **Conduct Tracker:** Monitoring and managing conduct-related activities with detailed tracking features.
- **Guard Duty Tracker:** Planning, scheduling, and overseeing guard duty activities seamlessly.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and access control for different user roles and permissions.
- **Nominal Roll:** Comprehensive list of all soldiers with essential details for reference and management.
- **Detailed Information Screen:** Individual screens for each soldier with in-depth information and data representation.
- **Sync Calendar Extension:** Integration with external calendar systems for synchronized event tracking and management.
- **Access Control:** Implementation of hierarchical access levels for improved data security and management.
- **QR Scanner and Generator:** Integration of QR code functionalities for streamlined data retrieval and validation.

## Known Issues

- Heavy reliance on user inputs without a means for assessment
- Security concerns and lack of multiple access levels
- Limited access to MINDEF Intranet for streamlined data retrieval
- Slow loading due to real-time data updates
- Cross-platform compatibility issues, particularly with iOS devices

We are actively working on resolving these issues to enhance the app's functionality and security.
